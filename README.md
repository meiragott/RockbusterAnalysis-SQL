---
## Introduction
Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a global movie rental company, is transitioning to an online video rental service to stay competitive against streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon Prime. This project involves performing a data-driven analysis using SQL to support Rockbuster Stealthâ€™s business strategy. The goal is to answer key business questions that will guide the company's transition to the digital market.

## Key Questions & Objectives
The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has posed several key questions to help shape the company's 2020 strategy:

1. Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
2. What was the average rental duration for all videos?
3. Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
4. Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
5. Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

The objective is to use SQL to analyze the data and provide clear, data-driven answers to these questions.

## Data & Tools

### Data Source

The dataset used in this project includes information on Rockbuster's film inventory, customers, and payments. The dataset was loaded into a PostgreSQL database for analysis.

### Tools

- **PostgreSQL**: An open-source relational database management system used to store and query the Rockbuster data.
- **SQL**: Structured Query Language used to perform data analysis and extract insights.
- **Excel**: Used for data visualization and presentation of findings.

## Visualizations

To effectively communicate the results of the analysis, several visualizations were created (*see link to Tableau Visualizations above*):

1. **Customer Geography: Revenue & Customer Count By Country**
2. **Bar Chart: Top 10 Revenues by Country and City**
3. **Customer Geography: Top 5 Customers**
4. **Film Genre Comparison: Rental Duration, Revenue & Movie Count**
5. **Top 10 & Bottom 10 Performing Movies**

These visualizations were created to aid the Rockbuster Stealth Management Board in understanding the data insights at a glance and making informed decisions for their business strategy.
